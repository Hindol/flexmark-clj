= flexmark-clj
A (very) thin wrapper around flexmark-java, in Clojure.

Turn `# Hello, world!` into a Hiccup-esque Clojure data structure `[:document {} [:heading {:level 1} "Hello, world!"]]` or into HTML. Uses https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java[flexmark-java] under the hood to parse and render.

== Usage

====

== Anatomy of a Marccup Node

A `node` is a vector of three things,

[
    :tag                                        ;; <1>
    {:attribute-1 value :attribute-2 value ...} ;; <2>
    [child-1 child-2 ...]                       ;; <3>
]
----
<1> A tag representing the _type_ of node,
<2> A map of its _attributes_, and,
<3> A vector of _child_ nodes.
